description: "There is a new Grid Enhancement Proposal (GEP) around minting and farming rewards. Dig in and bring your feedback!"
---

We're excited to announce the release of a new Grid Enhancement Proposal (GEP). This proposal is shaped by insightful feedback we've received from the community. Our aim with this proposal is to bolster the reliability and fairness of the ThreeFold Grid, while ensuring fair value is achieved for all participants.

**Proposal Summary**
<ul>
<li>95% and 98% uptime requirements for DIY and certified nodes respectively</li>
<li>50% of proof-of-utilization revenues will go to the farmer running the 3Node</li>
<li>Minting will be slashed for 1 month if the node cannot wake up within 30 minutes twice within the same minting period</li>
<li>When we reach 1 Billion TFT on Stellar, minting stops on Stellar</li>
<li>TFT burning will stop</li>
</ul>

In addition to this update, we have an important announcement regarding the Farmerbot bonuses. Effective from the upcoming minting cycle, commencing on March 31, 2024, at 22:32:40 UTC, these bonuses will be discontinued.
