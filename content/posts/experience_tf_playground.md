Build in a truly decentralized environment with the TF Playground, home to more than 10 (and counting) easy-to-deploy weblets – from Virtual Machines and Kubernetes to CapRover, ownCloud, and Presearch. A sandbox of limitless possibilities awaits for the open source builders of a decentralized tomorrow.

* 🏀 [Mainnet Playground](https://play.grid.tf/)
* 🏐 [Testnet Playground](https://play.test.grid.tf/)
* 📚 [ThreeFold Manual](https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__manual3_home_new)
* 💬 [Testers Chat](https://t.me/threefoldtesting)

As a decentralized project, we encourage the community to get involved in spreading the word about what’s possible on the TF Grid – with people in your circles, on social media, etc. Together we build. 🙏

Have ideas for getting the word out? Have questions or need resources? Please open a topic on [the forum](https://forum.threefold.io/) and we’ll solve it together.
