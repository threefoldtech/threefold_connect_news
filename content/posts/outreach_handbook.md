One goal we have for 2023 is furthering the decentralization of ThreeFold by empowering the community to take action independently. In this spirit, Sam & I compiled relevant information that will be useful for those ready to spread awareness of the project.

<br/>

Within the [ThreeFold Content Creation and Outreach Handbook](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-content-creation-and-outreach-handbook/3686), you'll find a simple & clear guide. Don't hesitate to offer suggestions and ask questions in the replies section. As always, we are happy to support!
