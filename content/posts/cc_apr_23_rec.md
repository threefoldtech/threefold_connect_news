For those who couldn't make it yesterday or would like a second look, please find the recording of the call [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/april-2023-tf-grid-4-community-call-recording/3896).

<br/>

We went through TF Grid 4.0, which brings forward the Internet of Internets model, including topics such as why Grid 4 is needed for ThreeFold to scale, what‚Äôs new in version 4, why TFT remains important, the updated farming / tokenomics model, and how you can [participate](https://t.me/+C-KhvHiblfo2ZWVh).

Thanks to Weynand, Kristof, and Scott for sharing, and to all those who were able to join live.
