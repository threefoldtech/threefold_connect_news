We are pleased to share a proposal and community vote to update the GEP voting process, to allow all TFT holders to participate in governance of the project.

**Proposal Highlights:**

- Voting is open to anyone holding TFT in a TFChain mainnet wallet
- Voting weight is 1 TFT = 1 vote
- A proposal will pass if 50%+1 TFT or more are positive votes
- Voting period is 5-21 days

TTake a look at the [full proposal](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfchain-dao-gep-voting-process-update/4409). These changes are designed to streamline participation and empower every TFT holder to actively shape the future of our ecosystem.

**We encourage all farmers to vote on this GEP. Visit [dashboard.grid.tf](https://dashboard.grid.tf/), click on DAO, and cast your vote before Friday October 4th at 10am CEST.**
