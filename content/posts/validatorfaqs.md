ðŸš¨ **ThreeFold Validator Nodes Update!**

Weâ€™ve received many questions on our programs for the **L2 and L0 validators** since we opened registrations, so we compiled this [Validator FAQ](https://forum.threefold.io/t/all-you-need-to-know-about-our-validator-programs/2208?u=hannahcordes) for you. In [this post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/all-you-need-to-know-about-our-validator-programs/2208?u=hannahcordes), you will also find more information on the next steps like verifying applications and deploying the validators.

**[Validator FAQ & Next Steps](https://forum.threefold.io/t/all-you-need-to-know-about-our-validator-programs/2208?u=hannahcordes)**

*Weâ€™re looking forward to driving the decentralization of the ThreeFold Grid with all of you. If you have further questions, please let us know in the comments.*
