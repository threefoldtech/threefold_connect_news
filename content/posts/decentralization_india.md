ThreeFold support team member Ashish wrote a piece recently about how the decentralization of the Internet would (will) help his home country. Read it [here](https://www.threefold.io/blog/decentralised-internet-india/)!

<br/>

This is [a great example](https://forum.threefold.io/t/nice-example-of-how-we-can-decentralize-and-diversify-the-communication-about-threefold/3680) of how anybody can get involved in the communication around ThreeFold.

<br/>

*Remember: a decentralized movement is all about decentralized action & participation. The more the members of the community talk about ThreeFold from our own unique perspectives, the more exposure & momentum we gain.*
