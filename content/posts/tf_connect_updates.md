In this edition of the ThreeFold Product Focus series, Sasha dives into upcoming improvements to the ThreeFold Connect app as part of TF Grid 3.8.0. Some highlights:

💰 **Wallet v3.3.0:** The ability to initiate, import and convert wallets to public wallets; send and receive tokens by using TF Connect username; and changing your wallet’s visibility.

👩‍🌾 **Farm Management:** Node status information will now be available on the ‘Farm Details’ page, farms will now be able to be deleted straight from the app, and more.

You can find more details [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tf-product-focus-tfconnect-app-tfgrid-v3-8-0/3409).

Thanks to the software engineers who have been working hard to bring these updates live to production!
