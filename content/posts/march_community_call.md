A warm welcome to those who are new to the project. Please dig in to our materials, ask questions, and get involved.

We have a [community call](https://t.me/threefoldnews/636) this Wednesday. You are welcomed to join or watch the recording!

ðŸš¨ **Please Be Mindful**

As attention grows, there are and will be people and groups trying to take advantage. For example, this [Telegram community](https://t.me/threefoldTG) which has popped up is entirely fake. (Please help by reporting it as spam.)

Please also be mindful of scammers and spammers generally. We see new accounts are being created falsely representing the project or individual team members. ThreeFold team members will never randomly reach out with special promotions or asking for your personal details.

*ThreeFold is a participatory movement. Together we are democratizing the Cloud & Internet landscape and enabling a better digital world. Together we build.*
