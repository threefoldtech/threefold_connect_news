After successful testing of TF Grid 3.12 on Testnet, we are ready to start the release process of this version on Mainnet.

For this to pass, we will need enough farmers to vote affirmatively before Monday December 11th at 10AM CET on [the dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/) under 'DAO.'

## New in this Release

The user interface has undergone a series of noteworthy improvements, resulting in an overall enhanced user experience. In addition, documentation has been updated to ensure clarity for users, such as Presearch, Nextcloud, and others.

Take a look at the full details [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/gep-for-3-12-on-mainnet/4151).

*In the meantime, the team is also working hard on developing and testing the new features for [TFGrid 3.13](https://forum.threefold.io/t/3-13-upcoming-updates/4149).*
