ðŸ’¬ **Recent Interviews & Discussions for the Team**

In case you missed it:

Weynand appeared on [the UAE Tech Podcast](https://www.albawaba.com/business/uae-tech-podcast-threefold-layer-zero-and-peoples-internet-1477554) to explain how ThreeFold works in layman's terms and the importance of a "People's Internet."

Sacha joined [Mainstay Digital](https://mainstaydigital.com/verticals/macro-visions/macro-visions-doing-to-the-internet-what-bitcoin-did-to-money-with-sacha-obeegadoo/) to discuss how ThreeFold is doing to the Internet what Bitcoin did to money.

& Scott sat down with [Kyle Ellicott](https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-farmers-journey-through-yielding-defi-nodes-and-expanding-the-grid-with-threefold-a70a3e3b98ea) to talk about the farmer's journey and the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid.
