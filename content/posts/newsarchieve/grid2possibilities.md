While we **work to open testing of Grid 3.0** to our community, questions are coming in around how to get started testing the Grid today.

In **[this post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/what-you-can-do-on-the-threefold-grid-today/1220)**, Scott outlines **what’s currently available to test on Grid 2**.
