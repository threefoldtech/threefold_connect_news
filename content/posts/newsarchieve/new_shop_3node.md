We are pleased to share two exciting updates on the farming side!

<br/>

1. The long-awaited [Farmerbot feature is now ready for testing](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tf-grid-3-9-farmer-bot-on-qanet/3842) on QA Net. Get involved in testing and offering feedback to help the push to mainnet. Thanks to the team for the release and to the community for your patience.

<br/>

2. The first 3Node webshop outside of the marketplace [opened in Europe](https://forum.threefold.io/t/first-3node-webshop-outside-martketplace-opened-today-in-europe/3841). Kudos to Robert / HostService for the launch. From Robert: "We thank the Threefold team for their trust and applaud them for decentralising their project even more with this step. This allows us to provide even better and more efficient services and we are celebrating this by offering FREE SHIPPING in Europe."
