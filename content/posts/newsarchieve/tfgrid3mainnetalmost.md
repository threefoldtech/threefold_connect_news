👀 **TF Grid 3.0 mainnet is [almost there](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-mainnet-almost-there/1624/2)!**

*Update: Mainnet has been launched yesterday, almost no capacity yet https://explorerv3.grid.tf/ but some farmers will add over next days. We expect to have much more in 1 week.*

*No big announcements yet, this is all close community news for now.* 🙏
