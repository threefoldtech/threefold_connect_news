Today, we're pleased to announce a partnership between ThreeFold Tech and [ODE](https://odeinfinity.com), the world's first vertically integrated consumer data ecosystem. ODE is creating a future where enterprises become trusted partners to their digital consumers, offering an application platform that enables privacy for digital consumers, lean data science, and compliance for enterprises. Built on blockchain and AI, ODE Infinity defines a new paradigm for digital engagement for enterprises.

ODE recognizes the need for a secure, scalable, and cost-effective global infrastructure platform that complements the key attributes of ODE and furthermore meets the attributes demanded by more and more customers today. Priority attributes include data sovereignty and privacy, true decentralization, no lock-in, scalability, and ultra-security (to name a few).

ThreeFold technology and the ThreeFold Grid offers such an infrastructure platform and meets these exact attributes demanded by the customers today. ThreeFold brings a truly decentralized compute and storage network that ensures the privacy and sovereignty of customer data, scalability, cost efficiency, and ultimately a digital infrastructure that is far more sustainable for our planet.

"The collaboration between ODE and ThreeFold is a tremendous win for enterprises and consumers that are wrestling to find a balance between data privacy, compliance, and business growth to build trust. Our joint offering does exactly that by creating a decentralized data ecosystem that enables enterprises to become trusted partners to their digital consumers. The new world where privacy is by design, usage is by consent, and value realization is unlimited and mutual," says ODE CEO Sashi Edupuganti. "The synergy between ODE and ThreeFold will accelerate the journey toward a more decentralized and democratic way to manage and use consumer data."

ODE and ThreeFold Tech have now signed a collaborative agreement to deliver solutions that accelerate their collective mission of democratizing data and creating greater data management capabilities for enterprises, and self-determination and sovereignty for all people. We will update as this partnership evolves.
