ðŸ“£ **For those who pre-registered, here's a 24 hour heads up: the Titan v2.1 3Node is just about ready to pre-order!**

Keep an eye on your inbox (with the email you used to pre-register) tomorrow at this time for a link to the node shop where you'll be able to pre-order your 3Node with priority before we open to the wider public.

*For everyone else, you'll have your chance 24 hours after that.*
