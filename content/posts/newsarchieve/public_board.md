Story time!

<br/>

There was a particular incident where a user saw that their deployment wasn‚Äôt accessible and reported it on the telegram channel. The farmer was responsive, found out the 3node was down, and got it back up! So all ended relatively well. 

<br/>

However, thinking long-term, how can we cater for such ‚Äúproblems‚Äù when there will be many more farmers and users on the ThreeFold Grid? 

<br/>

Mik thought about this and came up with a solution! He proposed a new tool for farmers and users to communicate with each other in case of maintenance, network/deployment issues: [a Public Board](https://forum.threefold.io/t/public-board-to-announce-3node-maintenances-and-more/3863).
