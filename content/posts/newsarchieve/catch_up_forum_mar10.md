ðŸ”’ It seems we are approaching a consensus on how to proceed regarding [locking TFT value during deployments](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tft-locked-value-during-deployment/3675/27?u=victoriaobee).

<br/>

ðŸª™ The thread replies to the proposal of [decommissioning the BSC bridge](https://forum.threefold.io/t/decomission-bsc-bridge-and-pegged-token/3813) point toward the fact that the community wants TFT to stay on BSC, at least until we can have another major chain supporting TFT.
