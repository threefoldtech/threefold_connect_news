Hereâ€™s [part two](https://forum.threefold.io/t/ict-tanzania-update-2-ourworld-mkusanyiko/3459) in our series of updates about last weekâ€™s ICT Conference in Tanzania.

We were thrilled to host Tanzanian Minister for Information and Communications Technology Nape Nnauye and his team, along with government and fintech leaders of the region to connect and share around the ThreeFold vision.
