Since we are now moving more and more to Grid V3, we wanted to explain how [the billing process works](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-deployment-costs-get-calculated/2486) for deployments. Some highlights:

Grid V3 has implemented a post billing system, meaning you will get billed for the capacity you are using after you have deployed a workload. *No need to spend unnecessarily for capacity you won't need.*

We also provide [discounts](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/#/tfgrid/pricing/threefold__pricing?id=discount-levels) for workloads if your account has a certain amount of balance. *This way you can enjoy cheaper deployments whilst you are holding TFT in your account.*
