It's now easier than ever to get started with ThreeFold â€“ from buying and storing TFT to setting up and optimizing a farm to building on top of the grid!

**Check out the [updated manual](https://manual.grid.tf/).**

The manual has now been divided into different sections for different audiences â€“ farmer, developer, or system administrator â€“ along with an introduction and an extensive general info section. And a 3Bot section is coming soon!

We look forward to your feedback and keep in mind the manual is open for [contributions from the community](https://manual.grid.tf/contribute/contribute.html).

*Thanks to the efforts of the team for bringing these updates live!*
