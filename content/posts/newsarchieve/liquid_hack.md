We wanted to update the community that Liquid, an exchange on which TFT is listed, [shared this morning](https://twitter.com/Liquid_Global/status/1428176357515612165?s=09) that warm wallets on the exchange were compromised in a hack.

**It appears that Stellar-based assets (e.g. TFT) were not stolen.**

Please take note:

- 🚫 Liquid has halted all crypto withdrawals while we assess the impact.
- ✅ Fiat withdrawals and deposits remain available.
- ✅ Other services on Liquid, including trading and Liquid Earn, remain available.
