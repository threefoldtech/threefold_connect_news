Recently, Scott (from the TF Foundation) interviewed Jonas Delrue from Jimber, the team developing P2P solutions like video chat and office workspace, using the Digital Twin platform. Digital Twin is a use case on top of the ThreeFold Grid.

ðŸ’¬ You can find the interview *[here](https://threefold.io/blog/post/interview_with_jimber/)*.

Itâ€™s quite a fascinating discussion and gives insight on the technical hurdles and motivations for developing private, decentralized, and open source alternatives to popular products from major corporations.
