---

Fresh off Drew's press, find new tutorials to guide you through deployments on the Grid: 
- [Start deploying on the playground](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-setup-to-deploy-your-first-workload-on-the-playground/3739)
- [Choosing your first deployment](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-deploying-your-first-workload-on-the-threefold-playground/3740) 
- [Accessing your newly deployed VM](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-accessing-your-ubuntu-vm-deployed-on-the-threefold-grid/3741)
- [Testing out these tutorials](https://forum.threefold.io/t/creating-a-cloud-linux-desktop-environment-on-the-threefold-grid/3731)

<br/>

Using these resources, you'll be able to take part in the [Tech Call Challenge](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-tech-call-challenge/3733), inspired by the discussion from [last Monday's call](https://forum.threefold.io/t/01-23-23-weekly-community-q-a-and-technical-call-recording/3732), where lots of ideas were shared. 

<br/>

Drew also gave a 'facelift' to his documentation about using Terraform to build on the Grid, making them more readable & easy to follow. Check it out:
- [General Getting Started with Terraform Guide](https://forum.threefold.io/t/are-you-ready-to-create-your-first-terraform-deployment-heres-how/3670)
- [Linux Quickstart Guide](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-deploy-a-terraform-example-configuration-on-the-threefold-grid-from-linux-in-7-steps/3672) 
- [Windows Quickstart Guide](https://forum.threefold.io/t/deploying-an-example-configuration-with-terraform-on-windows-using-putty-in-7-steps/3671) 
- [Single VM main.tf Guide](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-do-i-create-a-single-vm-main-tf-to-deploy-with-terraform/3738) 
- [Multi VM main.tf Guide](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-do-i-create-a-multi-node-terraform-deployment-in-2023-explained/3669) 


<br/>

You can join next week's [Tech Help call hosted by Drew on Monday Jan 30th](https://forum.threefold.io/t/weekly-community-q-a-and-tech-call-on-monday-january-30-2023-at-12-00-pm-noon-central-us-time/3734) with any questions!
