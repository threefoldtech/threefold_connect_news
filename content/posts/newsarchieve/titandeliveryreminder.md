ðŸ“¦ **Titan Delivery Update & Reminder**

Global Titan shipping is ongoing in all regions!

If you ordered a Titan but have not yet received it, it could be that we are missing information from you. Please make sure you have created your V3 farm to ensure quick delivery.

Our support team is available via [threefold.io](https://threefold.io) or on the ThreeFold Connect app with any questions.

*If you are an existing farmer and still need to [upgrade to V3](https://forum.threefold.io/t/farming-migration-grid-v2-v3/2143?u=hannahcordes), please do so asap.*
