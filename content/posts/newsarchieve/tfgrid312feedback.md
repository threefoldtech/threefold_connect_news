As shared on yesterday's community call, the team has been working on [a proposed update](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-3-12-proposal-and-discussion/4031) to the Grid and TFT tokenomics, a move towards maximum decentralization.

It's important that the community participates in providing feedback and suggestions, to help finalize the mechanism and parameters. Please dig in and leave your comments either on the forum or in the doc itself.

We're also pleased to announce a review call for the proposed update for next Wednesday August 9 at 5pm CEST / 11am EDT. Call link [here](https://bit.ly/tfcommunitycall).
