Join us next week, on Tuesday 21st at 17:00 CET / 12:00 EDT for [March's Community Call](https://forum.threefold.io/t/march-community-call/3840)!

<br/>

This session will be focused on going over relevant topics discussed in our main chat recently: our website UX, outreach, and making it easier overall for people to join in on the project and take action. 

<br/>

We expect input from community members and invite you to join with your ideas and suggestions, and perhaps even expert knowledge in the field, so we can have a fruitful open discussion!

<br/>

Besides, don't forget to join us tomorrow for [Brainstorm Session #2 about ThreeFold DMCC & Grid Commercialization](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-dmcc-grid-commercialization-brainstorm-round-two/3835) at 17:00 CET / 12:00 EDT. 

<br/>

Looking forward to interesting conversations during these two upcoming meetings, see you there!

<br/>
