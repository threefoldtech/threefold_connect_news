Thank you to those who joined us live for yesterday's community conversation. For those who missed it, the recording is now [live](https://forum.threefold.io/t/april-2024-community-discussion-recording/4303). Please note feedback for TF Grid 3.14 is still appreciated. You can find relevant links inside.

In the coming weeks, we will have more community conversations where we discuss how to implement feedback from the community for either 3.14, 3.15, or 4.0 releases of the TF Grid.
