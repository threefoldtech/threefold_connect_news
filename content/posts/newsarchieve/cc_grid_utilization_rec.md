For those who missed last weekâ€™s grid utilization community call, please find the recording in [this forum post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-november-3-grid-utilization-community-call-recording/3476).

Thanks to Weynand and Scott for sharing about dedicated nodes, full virtual machines, solution provider fees, and a lot more. And thanks to Theo for sharing about Zonaris, the Node as a Service platform being built on top of ThreeFold.
