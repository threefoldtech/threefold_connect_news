As mentioned in our [September Update](https://forum.threefold.io/t/september-02-2023-update-from-the-threefold-team/4060), the team is looking for feedback on [several topics](https://forum.threefold.io/c/collaboration/grid-350/116) related to TF Grid 3.5 (formerly 3.12), including [Validator & Farm Staking](https://forum.threefold.io/t/validator-and-farm-staking/4056/2?u=gosam).

Your input is greatly appreciated on this key grid upgrade. It's important we reach consensus, together as a community.
