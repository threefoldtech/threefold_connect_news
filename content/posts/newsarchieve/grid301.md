We have been, for some months, in testing mode on our ThreeFold Grid 3.X and today we are sharing **whatâ€™s new in TF Grid 3.0.1 â€“ and the path to mainnet!** ðŸš¨

Including: improvements suggested for 3.x farming model, a web-based widget to simplify calculations, validator nodes, a DAO, and what we still need to for mainnet!

**Find the full update [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/whats-new-in-tf-grid-3-0-1-and-the-path-to-mainnet/1488).**

*And a big thank you to the testers & farmers who have offered your time & feedback in helping us get to where we are today!*
