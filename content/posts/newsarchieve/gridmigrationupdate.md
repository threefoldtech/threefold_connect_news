ðŸ§³ **Grid V2 to Grid V3 Migration Update**

Since we are now live on TF Grid 3.0, it is important that all farmers who are still on Grid 2.x migrate their farms to the newest mainnet.

Thanks to all farmers who have already migrated, and for those who still need to migrate, please note the forum is open for questions if you have any!

*Also important: V3 farming rewards have been sent, so please get in touch with the support team via threefold.io live chat if you are not seeing rewards in your wallet.*
