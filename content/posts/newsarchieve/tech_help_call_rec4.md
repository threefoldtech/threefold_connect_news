Did you miss the last Tech Help Call?

<br/>

No worries, the recording is right [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/01-30-23-weekly-threefold-community-q-a-and-tech-call-recording/3751)! Thanks to Drew for hosting yet another insightful session. 

<br/>

In this one, he introduces Umbrel, tells us about what it is and gives us a demo of how to use it on the Grid (since then he also released a [tutorial](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-deploying-umbrel-on-the-threefold-grid/3752)). He goes on to explore multiple questions about ThreeFold, including 'How The Grid Can Help Data Security and Sovereignty', 'How Threefold Can Provide a Personal Cloud', and 'How Is Threefold Using Blockchain technology' amongst others. Discussion about how a family, a real estate developer or even a large community can use Threefold to host their own cloud and take back control of their data was also on the agenda!

*Save the date: every monday at 19:00 CET / 12:00 EST for upcoming Tech Help Calls!*
