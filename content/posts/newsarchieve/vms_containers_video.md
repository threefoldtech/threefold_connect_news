Scott is back, this time with [an informational / educational presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5uH0qBJtQo) about full virtual machines, micro virtual machines, and containers.

<br/>

He explores how these three technologies are at play on the grid, how you can use each of them in deployments, and some of their advantages and quirks. A great resource for grid users and those looking to get started on the grid!

_Note: This is an informational video, rather than a demo or tutorial. For more info on how to work with micro VM images, see this [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM9fikszyss) from Scott_
