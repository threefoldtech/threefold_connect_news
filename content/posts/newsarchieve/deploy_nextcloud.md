In [this demo](https://youtu.be/DIhfSRKAKHw), appropriately titled "Zero to Hero in 10 minutes," Weynand takes us through the steps of deploying a Nextcloud instance on top of the ThreeFold Grid, and tries to do the whole deployment in under ten minutes.

<br/> 

This time, Weynand uses Terraform to first launch the Virtual Machine within which the Nextcloud instance will run, and then uses Docker to install Nextcloud. Please note it's also simple to launch a Virtual Machine using the ThreeFold Playground, which Weynand touches on.

<br/> 

Also, shoutout to Teisie for providing the farm on top of which Weynand decided to do his demo.
