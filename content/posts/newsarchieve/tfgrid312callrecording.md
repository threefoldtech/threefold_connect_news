Earlier this week, team and community gathered to discuss TF Grid 3.12, a proposal to further the decentralization of ThreeFold and improve our tokenomics.

It was a productive call and we will have another one soon (date and time TBA).

If you would like to voice your input still, it's not too late! Please take a look at [the recording](https://youtu.be/VcNZvp_PhPs) and [the notes](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-3-12-proposal-and-discussion/4031/16?u=gosam) from the call and get involved on the forum.

*Have a great weekend all.*
