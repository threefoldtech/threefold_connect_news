Last week we announced our plan to make the ThreeFold Token more accessible through multichain integrations – with Binance Smart Chain up first!

**Today we are happy to update that the BSC integration is going just as planned and next week, TFT will be available there.**

**Please note that our next announcement will include the official contract address and the pair contract. If you don't see it from us, it's not authentic.**

We can’t wait for this integration to be live and to share the good news and details with you, our beautiful community. Thanks for your support!

*If you have questions, please be reminded of [our two-way chat](https://t.me/threefold) and [our forum](https://forum.threefold.io/).*
