We are pleased to announce that the voting phase for the proposed GEP from last week is now underway. 

Last week, we shared [a GEP proposal](https://forum.threefold.io/t/gep-minting-and-farming-rewards-updates-march-2024/4285) around minting and farming rewards updates, and we are ready to take a vote.

<ul>

<li> 

Any ThreeFold Farmer may vote on the proposal by visiting the [ThreeFold Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/) and clicking on the DAO section. [Read the manual for more information on the DAO](https://manual.grid.tf/documentation/dashboard/tfchain/tf_dao.html).

<li>The voting period will end one week from today: Friday, April 12 19:55 CEST | 13:55 EDT.</li>
</ul>

We appreciate the feedback brought by the community on this GEP and we look forward to discussing and incorporating ideas into upcoming GEPs as it makes sense.

We are also excited to invite you to a community discussion scheduled for next Thursday. This interactive session will be conducted via a two-way call format. 

Our focus will be the current GEP, future GEPs, TF Grid 3.14, and the cooperative. 

Feel free to bring your topics.

In addition to this, we're laying the groundwork to achieve regular community calls, we aim to hold 3-4 calls each month, each with distinct goals and objectives tailored to the needs of our community.
