The peer-to-peer ThreeFold Cloud can already support:

- ✅ Classic IT Workloads
- ✅ Blockchain As A Service
- ✅ Internet of Things or 5G Workloads
- ✅ High Security IT Workloads (e.g. Banking)
- ✅ “Beyond Blockchain” (e.g. Secure Archive)

The Marketplace provides ready-made solutions that are available for communities seeking alternatives to centralized services.

And later this year, any DApp developer will be able to run their JavaScript app on the ThreeFold Grid as well!

Currently, TF Grid 2.5 is ready for testing! If you'd like to get involved, you can join [here](https://bit.ly/tftesting)
