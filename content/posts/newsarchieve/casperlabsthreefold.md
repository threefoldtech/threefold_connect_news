Today, we are THRILLED to announce our collaboration with [CasperLabs](http://casperlabs.io/), the team behind the Casper Network. 🤝

Together, we will further CasperLabs' decentralization efforts while accelerating a collective mission and vision of achieving more equally distributing global wealth and resources – doing so through creating more opportunities for people and enterprises around the world, without limits. 🌏
