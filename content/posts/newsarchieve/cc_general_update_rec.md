For anyone who missed the community call yesterday, please find the recording and slides [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-october-24-2022-community-call-town-hall-recording/3443).

We greatly appreciate those who attended live and encourage everyone else to take the time to watch the recording. It was an in-depth session and it's a fantastic opportunity to get caught up on all things ThreeFold.
