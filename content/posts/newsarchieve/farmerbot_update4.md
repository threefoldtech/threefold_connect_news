Here's a positive follow-up update about the farmerbot feature from Brandon:

<br/>

"Good news. We were able to fix the issue mentioned before. The farmerbot is now able to shutdown nodes in a few minutes and bring them back on. To make sure everything is as expected we will be running some more testing today. Next week we should be able to invite the community to test it too. Please reply to this message if you are interested in testing the farmerbot with us.

<br/>

We are very thankful for your patience, weâ€™re almost there! ðŸ’ª"
