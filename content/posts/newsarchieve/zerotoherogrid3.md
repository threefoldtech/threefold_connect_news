ü¶∏ **From Zero to Hero: Deploying a VM on TF Grid 3**

Thanks to Weynand for [this great demo](https://forum.threefold.io/t/from-zero-to-hero-deploying-a-virtual-machine-on-tf-grid-3-in-under-10-minutes/1803) where he attempts to go from ‚Äúzero‚Äù (nothing installed) to deploying a Virtual Machine on TF Grid 3 in under 10 minutes!

For the technical audience, you‚Äôll be able to understand why this is so cool ‚Äì and for those who need some more explaining, not a problem ‚Äì we‚Äôve included info on Virtual Machines and some of the benefits of deploying them on the ThreeFold Grid.
