1. A new version of farmerbot [is live](https://forum.threefold.io/t/new-release-farmerbot/4014). We recommend Farmers to switch to v0.2.0 as soon as possible!

2. The manual is getting lots of improvements these days. Take a look at [what's new](https://forum.threefold.io/t/weekly-manual-update-news/4015) this week!

3. We have upgraded TF Grid Mainnet [to 3.10.1](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tf-grid-mainnet-release-3-10-1/4016) based on a GEP for enhancing security which passed last week.

*Have a great week, all!*
