Here's the latest update from Brandon:

<br/> 

"We have been testing the farmerbot the last couple of days. The farmerbot was able to shutdown 2 nodes on its own which is a good thing. But we noticed that shutting down the second node took over 30 minutes which is not what we expected. After some investigation we noticed a small issue that we are fixing right now.

<br/>

Thank you for your patience. We will be continuing our tests once this issue is fixed and keep you up to date."
