Weâ€™re thrilled to announce that the first TF Chain DAO proposal is now live and ready for voting, focused on the creation of the Gold Certified Farming Policy on TF Chain!

While weâ€™ve been using DAO votes on the forum (GEPs) to make decisions for some time, this will be the first time that an on-chain vote can directly initiate new functionality in TF Chain.

This is a very exciting step towards true decentralization whereby Grid stakeholders are in direct control of the future of the network!

Take a look at [the full update](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-first-vote-of-the-threefold-tf-chain-l1-dao-gold-certified-farming/3323n) for all the details.
