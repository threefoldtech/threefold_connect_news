The major note in this release is GPU Support but there are other nice features as well including Debian 12 support, grace periods, and more.

Take a look at the highlights of the TF Grid 3.11 release, which is now live for use on testnet!

Better yet, get to testing!
Together we build. 🙏️️️️️️

Thanks to all those involved in the TF Grid 3.11 release and to the testing community!
