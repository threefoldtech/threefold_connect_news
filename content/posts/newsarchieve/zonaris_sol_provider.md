Thanks to those who voted and congrats to the team at Zonaris!

Not sure what a solution provider is? A solution provider offers a solution on the ThreeFold Grid and receives 50% of the TFT utilization revenues from the workload related to the solution. You can dig further into this topic and how to become a solution provider [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-solution-provider-and-sales-channel/3746).

_We highly encourage those in the community who are building solutions on top of ThreeFold to [apply to become a solution provider](https://forum.threefold.io/c/dao/solution-provider-proposals/115)!_
