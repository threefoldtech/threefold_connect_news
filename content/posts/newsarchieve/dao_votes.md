While all farm owners are called to vote for [Grid 3.8](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-grid-v3-8-release-notes/3757) to go live on mainnet by February 17th, there is another ongoing DAO vote. 

<br/>

From [Dylan's post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/dao-proposal-for-approving-zonaris-as-a-solution-provider-on-chain/3786): "This morning we launched a DAO proposal to approve Zonaris as a solution provider on Tfchain mainnet! Voting ends on Wednesday February 22nd at 09:57:06 GMT+1"

<br/>

_To all those concerned, please make sure to vote ASAP.  You can vote by logging into [the dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/), selecting your farm and clicking on ‘Dao’ under the Portal menu._
