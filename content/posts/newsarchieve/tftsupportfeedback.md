While we continue to discuss tokenomics improvements for the 3.50 release, we also have an opportunity to implement some short term changes to help align incentives for farmers and support the token price.

Please give your comments on [this proposal](https://forum.threefold.io/t/start-farming-reward-lock-and-utilization-payments-to-farmers/4069) to initiate the locking of farming rewards and pay farmers for utilization on their nodes, starting with the 3.12 release.
