Our **TF Grid 2.4** has now been on testnet for over a month and we are getting good test results – but we need more!

We need **more [people who want to test](https://t.me/joinchat/BwOvOxxgK59GmRoZ2_sM0w)**, and we need more farmers who are willing to upgrade to the 2.4 (soon 2.5) release and make additional capacity available towards the community.

_Anyone who is interested to contribute in writing tests or executing on tests is more than welcome – the more exposure we get, the faster our TF Grid will be usable for a more general audience!_
