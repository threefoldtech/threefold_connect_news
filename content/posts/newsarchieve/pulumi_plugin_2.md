As [shared last month](https://forum.threefold.io/t/pulumi-plugin-for-tfgrid/4089), ThreeFold has introduced a plugin for Pulumi, a popular cloud-native open source IaC platform, which presents an alternative to Terraform. Take a look at the above post if you're curious for an introduction to Pulumi.

Today, [we present you](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-pulumi-plugin-examples/4115) the basic steps to test the various examples within the ThreeFold Pulumi plugin [repository](https://github.com/threefoldtech/pulumi-threefold).
