Find all the details [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/community-call-schedule-for-may-2024/4324). Hope to see you there!

*We are looking into adding an events plugin for the forum (example [here](https://community.coops.tech/calendar)) which will make it easier to track upcoming events, and where community members can add their own events as well.*
