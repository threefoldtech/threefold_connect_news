ThreeFold now has a plugin for [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), a popular cloud-native open source infrastructure as code (IaC) platform.

The plugin provides developers with a way to deploy and manage their ThreeFold Grid resources using Pulumi. This means that developers can benefit from all of the features and benefits that Pulumi offers, such as cross-cloud support, type safety, preview and diff, and parallel execution â€“ still in the works. This is a powerful tool that can be used to deploy and manage a wide range of ThreeFold Grid applications.
