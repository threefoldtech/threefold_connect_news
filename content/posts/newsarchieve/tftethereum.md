We are pleased to share that a TFT [bridge](https://bridge.eth.threefold.io/) from Stellar to Ethereum is now up and running.

We still need to set up some initial liquidity in order to start swapping between TFT and ETH (or other currencies running on Ethereum). This will make it super simple for anybody on the Ethereum network to buy TFT. Exciting news!

More to be shared soon, including instructions for how to provide liquidity. Please [follow this thread](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tft-on-ethereum/3928) to stay updated.
