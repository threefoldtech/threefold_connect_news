As shared Friday [on the forum](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-power-management-feature-for-3-8-1/3721), the power management feature for ThreeFold Farmers is in development. Within the linked post you can find specs for the solution and also reply with your interest to test the first version, which should be ready by sometime next week. Exciting progress for the farming community â€“ and for all of us!
