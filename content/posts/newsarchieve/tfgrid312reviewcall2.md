Next Thursday August 24th at 5pm CEST, we will host a call (link [here](https://bit.ly/tfcommunitycall)) to bring an updated TF Grid 3.12 proposal to the table (based on the previous feedback) and get fresh input from the community.

We will share the proposal ahead of the call.

For those who are still interested, please take a look at [the recording](https://youtu.be/VcNZvp_PhPs) of the first call as well as [the notes](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-3-12-proposal-and-discussion/4031/16?u=gosam).
