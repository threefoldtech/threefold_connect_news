Last week, ThreeFold team members Weynand Kuijpers, Maximilian Rang, and Nickolay Babenko joined Satoshi Street Bets for an Ask Me Anything (AMA) to share ThreeFold with their community and expand awareness for the project.

*They covered a wide range of topics including ThreeFold's beginnings, the vision, some comparisons to other projects, and really went deep into the technology.*

**You can listen to the AMA recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIDRHaxZmzU).** And you can find Satoshi Street Bets on Telegram [here](https://t.me/satoshistreetbets).
