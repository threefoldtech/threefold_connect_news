During our project update call, we covered three key topics: demos, Project Internet Capacity, and grid operations.

Scott presented two July demos‚Äî[deploying NextCloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhoY0yLIm3w) on ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized grid and using [TFROBOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDGnEQh5SsU) to deploy 100 virtual machines in just over three minutes. Timur also showcased Juggler, an open-source CI/CD tool.

Kristof then updated us on Project Internet Capacity, including its fourth-generation launch, potential tokenomics, and fundraising strategies. He also sought community feedback on whether to prioritize fundraising or launch in parallel.

Lastly, we discussed grid development, operational issues, and ways to protect farmers and maintain grid stability.
