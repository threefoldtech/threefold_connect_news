An exciting element of our roadmap to ThreeFold Grid 3.0 is **the integration of Terraform into the TF Grid**.

*Terraform is a widely used open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool which enables developers to build, change, and version infrastructure in a safe and efficient way.*

ðŸ“š **[Read about Terraform](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-grid-3-0-supports-terraform/1184), how it works with the TF Grid, and what it means for grid users.**

*Keep an eye out for the Terraform demo coming tomorrow. Weâ€™ll also discuss on the community call!*
