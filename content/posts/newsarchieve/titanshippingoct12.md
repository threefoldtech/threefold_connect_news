Hi all 👋

We're pleased to share that last week, we began shipping Titan v2.1s ordered by September 10 to the European Union*. Many new farmers have already received their 3Nodes! 👩‍🌾

But many of you still haven't filled out the information needed to set up your farm(s). Please note we won't send your 3Node(s) out until we get this information.

If you ordered a Titan v2.1 and haven't done so, **[please fill out this short form](https://forms.gle/p8947F8kytTpcJKW6)** so we can get you your 3Node without unnecessary delays.

**All other locations will begin shipping in November. Thank you for your patience during this global hardware shortage. 🙏*
