While many projects have attempted to decentralize the Internet and the Cloud with blockchain technology, a layer-0 is still missing for Web 3.0 and DeFi to scale to mass adoption.

Now, a project called ThreeFold has joined the race after recently [announcing](https://apnews.com/press-release/kisspr/technology-middle-east-lifestyle-blockchain-dubai-079a0c910c55187206c58992347a8a1e) the launch of the first neighborhood cloud in the world.
