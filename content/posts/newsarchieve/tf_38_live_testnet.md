As of the 1st of February, TF Grid 3.8 is live on testnet. Take a look at the release notes [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-grid-v3-8-release-notes/3757). This release contains many exciting updates including [third party billing services](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/blob/12bc8842c7c321d22e36667a91dfc5d3c7d04ab8/substrate-node/pallets/pallet-smart-contract/service_consumer_contract_flow.md). By early next week, we will share a more detailed look at all the key highlights. In the meantime, we invite the [testing community](https://t.me/threefoldtesting) to explore v3.8 on testnet and provide feedback.
