Testing is a key aspect of maintaining a reliable cloud infrastructure. Because testing is such a thorough process, we can catch and correct bugs before they reach the mainnet, our “production” environment. Learn more about the testing process:

**Part I: Ensuring Quality for Users**
This section covers why testing is important and the three networks used for testing – Devnet, QAnet, and Testnet – before we release anything to mainnet. [Read more](https://www.threefold.io/blog/how-to-test-the-grid-part-one/).


**Part II: Overview of Manual & Automation Testing**
This section focuses on two key types of testing – manual, and automation – which combine to ensure a strong and dependable grid. It also explains how to report an issue found during testing. [Read more](https://www.threefold.io/blog/how-to-test-the-grid-part-two/).

A big thanks to all those who have contributed to testing the grid to date. We invite anyone to join the testing community and help ensure a smooth and reliable ThreeFold Grid. [Join here](https://t.me/threefoldtesting).
