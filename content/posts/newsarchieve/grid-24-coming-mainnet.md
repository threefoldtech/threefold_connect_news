Hi all â€“ we are pleased to share that we are in the final stages of testing Grid 2.4. We have found eVDC, 3Bot SDK, and Marketplace solution deployment & payment to be quite stable.

In the coming days we will have an exact date for mainnet launch and some more details for you to get started on our most exciting release to date!
