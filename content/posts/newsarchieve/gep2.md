ðŸš¨ **Update & Next Steps: The First Grid Enhancement Proposal**

Dear all,

We would like to thank the community for the support on last weekâ€™s [Grid Enhancement Proposal](https://forum.threefold.io/t/upgrade-proposal-for-minting-code-v3-2/2447). We are happy to announce that with 97% positive votes, we are now moving forward with this proposal and implementing all of the mentioned points as soon as possible.

Please keep in mind that this code adjustment on uptime requirements, as well as the rectification of last monthâ€™s payout (including the changed uptime requirements), will take some time.

1. Any missing payout for last months minting period - payout ASAP
2. Minting payout for March 2022 - payout 8th of April

As stated on the Grid Enhancement Proposal post, payout will happen on the 8th of April instead of the 5th of April to give us some more time to verify the process.

Kind regards,

The ThreeFold Team
