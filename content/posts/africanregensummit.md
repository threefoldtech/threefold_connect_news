Over the past four days, we have had the pleasure to host the African Regenerative Cities Summit in Zanzibar, Tanzania ‚Äì uniting top innovators and investors supporting human flourishing, with a special focus on science and technology that will lay the foundation for Africa‚Äôs future.

A lot has happened over the course of the summit, including a surprise visit today from an extremely special guest.

Generally, we have been blown away by the participants and the projects they are working on, and we warmly welcome many of them now into the ThreeFold community.

We'll be sharing more in the coming days.
