Some super exciting features coming as a part of TF Grid 3.8 (exact release date TBD), including 1. the ability to easily deploy your own Mastodon server 🐘 via a weblet on TF Playground, 2. a power management (savings) 💡 feature for unutilized nodes, and 3. on-chain support for third-party billing – meaning someone who builds a service on the grid can begin to receive payments 💸 from grid users!
