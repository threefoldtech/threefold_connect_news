ðŸ“° **ThreeFold Weekly! May 5th Edition (Volume Sixteen)**

Let's take a look at what's new since last week's update: ThreeFold was covered in *International Business Times*, we launched the TFT fiat gateway testing program (and we're looking for some more testers), the team is testing the ThreeFold Hub for validators and deligated stakers, two Grid Enhancement Proposals, and more. (Whew!)
