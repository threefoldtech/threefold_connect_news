Dive into the [upgraded ThreeFold Grid Dashboard](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-new-and-improved-tf-grid-dashboard-ui-ux/4202), designed for seamless TF Grid management and deployment. We've prioritized simplicity and intuition in the user experience. 

Discover outstanding features such as access to node resource details via node ID when selecting a node for deployment, statistics on dedicated nodes and GPU-equipped nodes, and billing rates for the month conveniently located under the contract tabs.

Testing starts next week! *Thanks to those in the community who have provided feedback and helped us to get to this milestone.*
