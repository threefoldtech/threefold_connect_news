Last week, ThreeFold made several announcements including the introduction of our Web4 vision and roadmap, along with several components and integrations / bridges which signal a move towards commercialization and general expansion.

### Web4 Vision

The story of the Internet is one of ongoing evolution. The Internet began as a decentralized ecosystem and became centralized over time. This has led to many challenges around security, efficiency and sustainability, misinformation and disinformation, and the loss of control over our data. Now with artificial intelligence, a new paradigm is emerging. Soon, we will all interact with AI agents to manage our digital lives. If we continue down the centralized path, these AI agents will also be out of our control, posing some alarming possibilities for our collective future. ThreeFold, amongst others, envisions a new way forward – where a decentralized infrastructure enables a digital world owned and operated by all of us, not just the few. Learn more by watching this video or reading our Web4 roadmap.

### Web4 Components

To achieve our Web4 vision, we’ve announced several new components. (If you’re curious to know more about all that we’ve done so far, read more [here](https://threefold.info/tech/).)

- **[3Phone](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3phone/)**: A secure smartphone based on Volla Phone.
- **[3Bot](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3bot)**: AI-driven virtual system administrator for effortless decentralized app management.
- **[3AI](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3AI)**: Decentralized AI assistant for private, secure use.
- **[3Router](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3router)**: Powered by Mycelium technology for seamless, secure global communication.
- **[3Node V4](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3node)**: Available now via trusted partners for decentralized cloud capacity.
- **[BTC Integration](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/bitcoin)**: Bitcoin adopted as a native payment mechanism.
- **TFT** availability on multiple blockchains, starting with Solana.

### What This Means

ThreeFold has always maintained a “for everyone” vision but the truth is that until now, ThreeFold was mostly relevant for “nerds” – developers and system administrators – and believers. These components, particularly the phone and its decentralized AI-driven capabilities, mean that ThreeFold is now relevant for a much wider audience, the everyday Internet user.

This also means we need to deploy a lot more capacity. We are extremely grateful for the community of farmers who have enabled the ThreeFold Grid. Together we have shown that a functioning decentralized cloud is possible. This was a huge effort. For the next phase of ThreeFold to come together, we’ll need millions of nodes, routers, and phones. But as the saying goes, there’s only one way to eat an elephant – piece by piece! And our expansion efforts will involve not just individual farmers but projects and organizations, communities, and even governments.

### What Happens Next

For sure we need to explain some things in greater detail. How the phone and router work exactly, for example. This will come in time, we are creating content on these topics as we speak.

We also need to get the word out. We are employing several strategies on our side, including reaching out to journalists and other press, podcasters, and KOLs. In Q1, we will host some X spaces with friends of the project. The community is also getting active with its own initiatives, more to come on that.

We know many of you still have questions about INCA. As shared in last week’s announcements, there is a separate team who will launch ThreeFold in the DePIN space and they will share updates when ready.

Additionally, you can expect our next major round of announcements on 03.03 of next year, with regular milestone announcements every three months – on 06.06, 09.09, and 12.12. That being said, there may be some additional big announcements before March – stay tuned.

### How to Support

ThreeFold is a community-driven project. We encourage you to do your part in spreading the word and sharing the message. For those who are interested, you can also order a phone or pre-order a phone or router. Find out more details [here](https://www.threefold.io/action/).
