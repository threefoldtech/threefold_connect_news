The [forum](https://forum.threefold.io/) has been quite active, find discussions, Q&A's, recaps, and more:

<br/>

ðŸ”’ Join an important discussion about a proposal to [lock TFT value during deployment](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tft-locked-value-during-deployment/3675/3). 

<br/>

ðŸŽ¥ Take a look at the recording of the [Weekly Technical Help Room](https://forum.threefold.io/t/weekly-technical-help-room/3627) hosted by Drew, and tune in next Monday for the next session! You can also find the recording of the [January Community Call](https://forum.threefold.io/t/january-16th-2023-weekly-tech-call-recording/3702) to catch up on lots of topics around ThreeFold.

<br/>

ðŸ“„ Thanks to Mik for summarizing and organizing a [Q&A from the Weekly Threefold Tech and January Community Calls](https://forum.threefold.io/t/q-a-from-the-weekly-threefold-tech-and-community-calls/3711), making it easier to find answers to any question addressed. 

<br/>

ðŸ©º Are you wondering about the self-healing & self-driving capabilities of the Grid? Scott clears out any common misconception in [this post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/self-healing-high-availability-and-the-grid-today/3705)!

<br/>

ðŸ¦£ For those who were wondering about the mastodon server being down, [Drew gave us an update](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forum.threefold.io/t/what-happened-to-the-threefoldcloud-com-sites/3712&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1674123620068533&usg=AOvVaw1cWMfcGQJBu_tqJMGlN8ps)! While the server is down, it was not due to a failure of the grid, but rather because it was deployed as a test environment - and the good news is that it was a successful proof-of-concept!

<br/>
