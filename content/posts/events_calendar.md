With more calls happening each month, we have created a [public ThreeFold Events calendar](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-events-calendar/4331) to continually update new calls, meetups, and other events.

This allows anyone to follow or subscribe and makes it easier to stay on top of whatâ€™s coming up.
