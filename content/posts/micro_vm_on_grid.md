Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM9fikszyss) where Scott demonstrates how to create and manipulate micro VM images for deployment on the ThreeFold Grid.

<br/>

‚ÄúUsing Docker, we'll work through the process of installing an application, in this case Umbrel, inside of a container image, and then converting that container into an flist for use on the Grid. The end result will be a reusable image that anyone can deploy or which could be used as the basis for a new weblet.‚Äù

_Here‚Äôs a [forum post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/deploy-umbrel-with-micro-vm-image-and-tailscale/3789) from Scott to help out, and keep an eye out for a second video this week which will show how easy it is to connect to VMs on the Grid using Tailscale, without needing public IPs, gateways, or Planetary Network_
