Following the interest given to [Kristof's message](https://forum.threefold.io/t/grid-commercialisation-brainstorm-call/3808) in the main chat last week, we have scheduled a call to discuss ideas regarding commercial uses of the Grid. It will be held on Tuesday February 28th, at 17:00 CET / 11:00 EST.
