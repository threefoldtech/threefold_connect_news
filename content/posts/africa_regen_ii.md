This past weekend, some of the team hosted a group of passionate entrepreneurs and actors working on innovative planet-first people-first projects in Africa, or interested in supporting Africa.

One key outcome was collaborating on an action plan with friends from Dar Es Salaam and Kenya that includes the deployment of ThreeFold infrastructure locally and a series of co-hosted developer sessions and hackathons in 2024.

Please take a look at the full event recap [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/recap-africa-regenerative-futures-summit-volume-ii/4136).
