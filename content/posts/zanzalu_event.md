This weekend, some of the team will be joining [Student Weekend](https://lemonade.social/event/66485bc7f40139b832e05abc/info) at [Zanzalu](https://zanzalu.super.site/), a five-week pop-up city event in Zanzibar spun off from Zuzalu in Montenegro last year. It aims to connect African builders, explore alternative forms of city organization, and foster a growth ecosystem.

At Student Weekend, we will show the audience how to deploy workloads on top of ThreeFold's decentralized cloud infrastructure and participate in an ideathon, which then leads to a hackathon in mid-June where participants will try to build and deploy their ideas on top of ThreeFold nodes.

*An exciting opportunity to interface with local builders and showcase ThreeFold technology!*
