Social Network is the first Bitcoin Staking Layer 2 on earth and one of our core utilization partners. Social Network will be integrated with and enhanced by ThreeFold technologies. This includes, but is not limited to, ThreeFold’s decentralized cloud – featuring Quantum Safe Storage and the Mycelium Network – as well as decentralized computation, and Zero OS.

Kristof (co-founder) and Florian (biz dev) will be joining the space and sharing about ThreeFold.
