In this week's call, Mik and Scott dive into Mycelium, a super exciting end-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay network that builds on the concept of Yggdrasil, created by the ThreeFold team. Mycelium enables P2P communication at a planetary scale. ðŸ¤¯

Call topics include: what is Mycelium, Mycelium vs IPv4 and IPv6, how to use Mycelium, how to install Mycelium inside a VM, and more.
