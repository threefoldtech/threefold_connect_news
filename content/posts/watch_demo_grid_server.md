In this video, Mik will guide you through setting up a Docker container running the grid HTTP server. The grid HTTP server provides an API for interacting with the ThreeFold Grid, which can be quite useful when developing apps on the grid.

Watch the call [here] (https://youtu.be/Ec2NdhuoIc4) with timestamps for simple navigation, and leave your feedback or questions [here] (https://github.com/Mik-TF/grid_http_server_docker).

We have an upcoming demo on creating new style full VM images.

TheeFold's new style of full VM image is simpler to work with and more resource-efficient. We'll cover how to create custom images, and how to create deployments based on those images. If you want to go deeper into the world of ThreeFold, Linux, and virtual machines, then this session is for you. 

*See you on December 3rd at 19:00 CET | 13:00 EST! Call link [here](https://bit.ly/tfcommunitycall).*
