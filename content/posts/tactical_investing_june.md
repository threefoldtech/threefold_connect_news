Yesterday, YouTube influencer [Tactical Investing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPRC2wIfZtAlzCa_6iKE46w) posted a video to his account "THIS IS HUGE...Better Than Akash Network? *Time Sensitive*" to share about the ThreeFold farming opportunity with his community.

And today, he posted another video comparing ThreeFold with Akash Network and Holo. "With a P2P compute lending device, the titanv2 has the potential to make you quite a bit in passive income over the next few years." The videos garnered more than 35,000 views (on the date of this post) and led to the Titan v2 3Node to sell out in a matter of hours.
