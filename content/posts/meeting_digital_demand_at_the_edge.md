description: "Learn about the challenges centralized cloud infrastructures will have with growing digital demand and how edge computing platforms like ThreeFold bring a solution."
---

Edge computing offers a solution to traditional centralized cloud infrastructure challenges by processing data closer to its source. This approach reduces latency, conserves energy, and enhances bandwidth efficiency. By distributing processing tasks closer to the data source, edge computing improves scalability and efficiently handles increasing workloads. 

Additionally, it bolsters data privacy and security by dispersing data across a distributed network of nodes, reducing the risk of data breaches. This model supports real-time applications and emerging technologies like AI-driven analytics and IoT ecosystems. As demand for cloud services grows, ThreeFold's decentralized, edge-centric cloud infrastructure offers a sustainable, efficient, and transformative future for cloud computing.
