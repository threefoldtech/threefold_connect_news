Some of the team recently attended the Tanzania Annual ICT Conference where ThreeFold co-founder Kristof De Spiegeleer participated in two separate panels.

He took the opportunity to underline the importance of a sovereign Internet and the incredible potential of an open source and decentralized ecosystem to build Tanzania's digital economy.

Above, take a look at a short video where Kristof laid out the vision. And here are a few other clips from the same talk:
