Some of the team recently attended the Tanzania Annual ICT Conference where ThreeFold co-founder Kristof De Spiegeleer participated in two separate panels.

He took the opportunity to underline the importance of a sovereign Internet and the incredible potential of an open source and decentralized ecosystem to build Tanzania's digital economy.

Take a look at some clips from the talk [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-tanzania-ict-conference-2023/4106).
