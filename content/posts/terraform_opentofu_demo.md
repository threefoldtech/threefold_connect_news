Terraform is the industry standard tool for defining and deploying infrastructure as code, automating provisioning across various cloud providers. It supports reproducible, scalable deployments and enhances collaboration and version control. OpenTofu is a fully open-source Terraform fork that is backward compatible with all prior versions of Terraform up to version 1.6. 

In this demo, Scott guides us through how to set up and manage infrastructure on the ThreeFold Grid using Terraform and OpenTofu, suitable for all experience levels.
