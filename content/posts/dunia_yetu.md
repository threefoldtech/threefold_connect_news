Together with a group of tech community leaders and innovators from Dar Es Salaam, we have kicked off a project called Dunia Yetu (Our World, in Swahili).

The primary goal of Dunia Yetu is to deliver a set of tools and a platform which will allow many thousands of coders in East Africa to create their own digital sovereign Internet. For now, it begins with the deployment of local ThreeFold infrastructure and a series of events and gatherings.

Learn more about the project and the initial steps we've taken [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/introducing-dunia-yetu/4147).
