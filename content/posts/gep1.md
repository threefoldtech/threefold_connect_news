üó≥ **Action Requested: Grid Enhancement Proposal**

Hi friends, particularly those in the farming community ‚Äì

As you many of you know by now, we came across a bug in the minting code which had a negative effect on some nodes on the TF Grid during last month's minting.

First of all, we want to thank the ThreeFold community for the way they reached out to us in regards to this. üôè

These events sparked a discussion on the current uptime requirements and as a result of that, **we created [a forum post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/upgrade-proposal-for-minting-code-v3-2/2447) with a poll where the community can vote** on the changes as suggested.

Please note that the poll will be closed on Friday March 18th at 8AM CET. If a minimum of 60% positive votes are achieved, we will implement these changes as soon as we can.

All the best,

ThreeFold Team
