As shared by Sabrina on the forum, "after successful testing of TF Grid 3.10 on QAnet, we are ready to start the release process of this version of the Grid on Testnet." Take a look at the improvements from this update [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tf-grid-release-3-10-testnet/3970).

The migration is ongoing! We'll advise in the main chat when it is complete and when the community can get to testing.

*Thanks to those who helped push 3.10 so quickly from QANet to Testnet.*
