Over the years, ThreeFold has joined hands with people across the world forming a dedicated community. We are very grateful to the community for your time, energy, resources, and overall commitment – together we have built a decentralized cloud that is now available across more than 50 countries.

We have now demonstrated that an autonomous self-healing cloud can be built, which needs minimal human intervention to keep it up and running. We have also successfully showcased that this system is a perfect DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) case – thousands of farmers have provided capacity, and many are actively using it.

On that note, today we announce the following new features that will prepare us for our commercial launch in 2025:

**[3Phone 5](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3phone/)**: A secure phone, based on the [Volla Phone](https://volla.online/en/) 4 platform, offering a robust solution for a protected digital life. 3Phones are available for pre-order [now](https://threefold.io/signup).

**3Bot**: 3Bot is your AI-driven virtual system administrator. With it you can manage decentralized applications effortlessly with 100% uptime, empowering users with complete control over their digital ecosystem. 3Bot is pre-installed on every 3Phone. Learn more about 3Bot [here](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3bot).

**3AI**: 3AI is an AI-driven agent (leveraging Morpheus AI) designed to empower individuals with a private, secure, and decentralized AI experience on the 3Phone. Learn more about 3AI [here](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3AI).

**[3Router](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3router)**: The 3Router is powered by our Mycelium technology, enabling seamless, secure communication between every person and machine on the planet. These routers form the backbone of a truly decentralized network, offering unmatched convenience, safety, and privacy. 3Routers will be available for pre-order Q1 2025 but you can express your interest [now](https://threefold.io/signup).

3Node: V4 nodes are available now and you can buy them directly via our official partners – [HostService](https://hostservice.nl/en/) (Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia) and [Duck Farm Data](https://duckfarmdata.com/) (Americas), both long-time participants of the ThreeFold community.

**BTC**: The ThreeFold ecosystem will fully embrace Bitcoin (BTC) as a native payment and reward mechanism. Users will seamlessly utilize BTC to access any product or service within the ThreeFold ecosystem, from deploying workloads to paying for services. Learn more [here](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/bitcoin).

TFT will be made available on multiple blockchains – Solana is the first one.

Today we make these announcements to our wonderful community, so you can provide your feedback and be amongst the first to register. In the coming weeks, after the new year, we will begin to spread this vision further. And this is only the beginning of our Web4 journey. Every three months, on 03.03, 06.06, 09.09, and 12.12 of next year we will continue to unveil major aspects of the Web4 vision. Of course there will be plenty of discussion and updates as we go, as well.

#### Remarks
- These announcements are made by the ThreeFold Technology creation team. Our job is to create the best possible products together with the community.
- A commercial launch is being planned for the DePIN community. More information will be available once the DePIN project team feels comfortable.
