In most distributed systems, data is stored multiple times to guarantee redundancy. This leads to a lot of unnecessary overhead and is also not the most secure mechanism.

Meet **the dispersed storage algorithm** – a crucial part of our storage system – which breaks data down into equations that are spread across nodes, leading to increased security, reliability, and efficiency, with much lower overhead.
