Started by the Green Edge team, [Zonaris](https://www.zonaris.io/) is a decentralized node deployment platform built on top of the ThreeFold Grid.

‚ÄúWe host your nodes on reliable, decentralised architecture. We don't believe Web3 nodes should be hosted on Web2 architecture owned and controlled by a handful of trillion-dollar companies ‚Ä¶ Existing NaaS ("node-as-a-service") companies use the old AWS/Azure services for their nodes which undercuts a central plank of Web3, namely, decentralisation.‚Äù

The team is hoping to hit 1,000 Streamr nodes on Zonaris soon, driving utilization on the grid ‚Äì and will also be offering nodes of other projects in the coming months.
