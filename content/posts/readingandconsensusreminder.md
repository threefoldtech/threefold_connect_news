ðŸ’¡ **ThreeFold Reading & Consensus Reminder**

We'd highly recommend the community to check out our latest blogs â€“ [Building the Future We Want to Live in â€“ A Four Step Journey](https://threefold.io/blog/post/four_phases_of_threefold/) & [Welcome to the Internet of Internets](https://threefold.io/blog/post/internet_of_internets/) â€“ to discover how we are positioning and scaling ThreeFold.

For a deeper look, dive into [ThreeFold Litepaper v17](https://litepaper.threefold.me/).

*Related: This week, the team will be at Consensus by CoinDesk, where ThreeFold is a sponsor (Booth 310)! We'll also be hosting a gathering with the Austin community centered on the co-creation of a sovereign regional Internet by and for the people of Austin. If you'll be in town, get in touch!*
