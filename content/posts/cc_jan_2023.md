It is almost time to gather for the first Community Call of 2023!  We will be discussing *[questions raised by the community](https://forum.threefold.io/t/community-call-questions-from-the-tf-members/3677)* and exploring our upcoming project: *ThreeFold Commercial Grid Services!* 

<br/>

Save the date: **Tuesday January 17th at 17:00 CET / 11:00 EST**

<br/>

We will be aiming to have a monthly gathering on the third Tuesday of every month, so you can already mark your agendas ahead of time! 

<br/>
